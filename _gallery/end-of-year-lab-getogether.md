Feels good to be out with this group (the professor included) to hangout and speak less task and more fun stories and experiences about Pizza's and many other thing that does not involve "increase-the-amplitutde" ðŸ˜‚. Personally, I have not always loved this kind of outings but this one, was good and I bet it would have been more fun had I not used 50% of the time getting myself lost in Ice-cold Moscow city due to miserable internet. Could have been worst outside if I wasnt pickup up, because I did not know the cold can switch off a fully-charged phone. In the end I made it to the table and recounting my experience, I feel it's important to factor these times in a labs' calender.
