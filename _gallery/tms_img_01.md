A very important component of TMS study to guide the navigation system of the location of the head at any point in time. We register Head markers a little differently in participant with MRI scan and the ones without. Points are from the nasion bone, inion (bone at t√•he occipital), from the two ears and also lateral eye socket bones of both left and right eye.
