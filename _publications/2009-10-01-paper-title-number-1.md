Thirteen healthy adults (mean age 23, with 7 males) participated. They received single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the left motor cortex while electromyography recorded activity from five right arm muscles, focusing on the biceps brachii. The study design involved two baseline measures (pre- and post-task) and four randomized tasks: a metronome-paced baseline and three motor imagery (MI) tasks—kinesthetic (KI) and visual imagery from first- (V1) and third-person (V3) perspectives. During MI tasks, participants executed a biceps flexion with a dumbbell in sync with a metronome before imagining the movement according to the assigned imagery type.

This study demonstrates that both kinesthetic and visual motor imagery—especially when viewed from a third-person perspective—significantly enhance corticospinal excitability in the biceps. The results underscore the importance of imagery perspective in modulating motor system activity, with potential implications for optimizing rehabilitation and motor learning interventions.
