About Me
======
I am a cognitive neuroscience researcher pursuing my master's degree in cognitive neuroscience, where I have developed a strong foundation in neuroimaging techniques, neuropsychology, computational sciences, and research design and execution. My academic journey has equipped me with the skills and knowledge necessary to explore the mysteries of the brain and contribute to groundbreaking research in this field.

My Vision
======
My long-term vision is to contribute to translational neuroscience, bridging fundamental research and clinical applications. I seek to explore the neural mechanisms underlying cognition and movement, with a focus on conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease, stroke, and traumatic brain injury (TBI). By integrating neurotechnology, neurostimulation, and multimodal neuroimaging experimentation, I aim to develop innovative interventions that enhance cognitive and motor recovery. Beyond research, I am passionate about inspiring and helping young scientists, particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds, to pursue careers in neuroscience.

Research Interests
======
- Neuromodulation & Brain Stimulation: Investigating how neuromodulatory technologies such as non-invasive transcranial stimulations (magnetic, electric, light) approaches influences memory, learning, motor control and other cognitive domains affected in neurological disorders.

- Neuroimaging & Computational Science: Applying neuromotnitoring such fMRI, M/EEG, and machine learning to analyze brain activity and develop predictive models of neuroplasticity and recovery.

- Neurorehabilitation & Translational Neuroscience: Developing interventions that enhance brain function, neurofeedback, and modeling for for neuroprotectiion, rehabilitation and healthy aging.


Professional Experience
=====
I have had the privilege of working in esteemed neuroscience labs and collaborating with experienced researchers from Ghana, Russia and other online opportunities. These experiences have honed my research skills, provided valuable insights into the scientific process, and inspired my resolve to contribute to advancing our understanding of neurotech for helping people.
