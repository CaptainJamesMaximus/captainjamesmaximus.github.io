### Motor Imagery (MI) Modulation Using tDCS and TMS  
**Date**: [2023] - Present  
**Role**: Lead, MI with TDCS Pipeline
<!-- **Collaborators**:    -->

This study investigates the neural mechanisms of motor imagery through a novel combination of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). tDCS is applied to modulate the visual or somatosensory cortex, while TMS is used to elicit motor-evoked potentials, measured via electromyography (EMG). The goal is to understand how cortical modulation influences motor imagery distintive MI modalities, with implications for advancing non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in motor control research and neurorehabilitation.

### Deep Learning for Classifying Motor Evoked Potentials Using CNN-LSTM  
**Date**: [2024] - Present  
**Role**: Independent Researcher  

This project applies deep learning techniques to classify and predict motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) recorded through electromyography (EMG) elicited with TMS in human participants. Using a hybrid convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture, the study aims to improve the reliability of MEP detection and prediction in non-invasive brain stimulation experiments. The outcomes have implications for enhancing the precision of TMS-based motor control studies.
