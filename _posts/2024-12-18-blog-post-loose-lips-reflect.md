The phrase "Loose lips sink ships" originated during World War II as a caution against careless talk that could jeopardize critical operations. After 80 years of its usage, the phrase serves as a timely reminder in the era of neurostimulation and neuroplasticity research. Inconsistency in protocols can undermine the progress of our field, hindering reproducibility and delaying the development of life-changing therapies. 

Duly recognizing the contribution of the brain's complexity in these inconsistencies, the lack of considerably best and adequate protocol sharing and methodological replications also has a bite. 

As neuroscientists, we have a responsibility to foster a culture of open, transparent, and collaborative science. By sharing data, protocols, and ethical considerations, we can accelerate discovery, ensure the reliability of our findings, and ultimately improve human lives.

Let's navigate the complexities of the brain together, steering the ship of neuroscience toward a future built on trust, rigor, and innovation.
